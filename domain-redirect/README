This directory's .htaccess file provides a simple redirect for khanacademy.org --> www.khanaacademy.org, maintaining query params and such. We use this because:

1) App Engine doesn't support naked domains
2) Amazon's Route 53/S3 redirect service doesn't support HTTPS
3) Google Apps' 'naked domain redirection' service doesn't maintain query parameters.

Current Amazon Elastic IP for this instance: 23.23.224.106
