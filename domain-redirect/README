This directory's .htaccess file provides a simple redirect for khanacademy.org --> www.khanaacademy.org, maintaining query params and such. We use this because:

1) App Engine doesn't support naked domains
2) Amazon's Route 53 DNS doesn't provide a redirect service
3) Google Apps' 'naked domain redirection' service doesn't maintain query parameters.

Current Amazon Elastic IP for this instance: 107.20.223.238
