-- Troubleshooting HipChat

If HipChat notifications are firing successfully, according to the
Jenkins logs, but not appearing in HipChat, it may be that the wrong
parameters are being passed.

When a build selects the post-build step "HipChat Notifications", it
binds into the local config.xml whatever the global hipchat
configuration was at the time this is selected. So, it's easy for this
to get out of date with the global config.


If HipChat notifications are failing it may have to do with SSL certificate
signing. Check for security errors in the logs (/var/log/jenkins/jenkins.log).

OpenJDK ships with empty certificates. One solution is to install the Sun JDK
with its valid certificates and point OpenJDK at them:

  1. Install the Sun JDK
     $ sudo apt-get install sun-java6-jdk

  2. Point OpenJDK at the Sun JDK certificates
     $ cd /etc/ssl/certs/java
     $ sudo mv cacerts cacerts.old
     $ sudo ln -sn /etc/java-6-sun/security/cacerts
