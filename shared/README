This directory has scripts and files that are useful for many ec2 machines.

In general, an ec2 directory should not use scripts in 'shared'
directly.  Rather, they should symlink from their own
aws-config/<whatever>/ directory:

    aws-config/mymachine% ln -snf ../shared/etc/nginx.conf etc/nginx/confg

This way, we have a record of what shared functionality is used where.

However, setup.sh should feel free to source shared/setup_fns.sh
directly.
