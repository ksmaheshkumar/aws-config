     $ sudo yum install postfix

3) On the ec2 machine, run
     $ hg clone http://khanacademy.kilnhg.com/Code/Website/analytics/stable analytics

   subdirectory (you may have already done this).

4) Install the crontab:
     $ crontab analytics/cfg/aws/ka-high-mem/crontab

5) Install the dotfiles:
     $ for i in cfg/dot_*; do cp -a "$i" "~/.`echo $i | sed s,cfg/dot_,,`"

   http://www.uponmyshoulder.com/blog/2010/set-up-a-mail-server-on-amazon-ec2/
