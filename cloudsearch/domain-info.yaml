analysis_schemes:
    # These are the analysis schemes we use. Creating and using analysis
    # schemes is how we configure CloudSearch features such as algorithmic
    # stemming, dictionary stemming, stop words, and a few others. See the
    # Configuring Text Analysis Schemes for Amazon CloudSearch document in
    # AWS CloudSearch's documentation for more information.

fields:
    # These are the fields that documents in the index will contain. Possible
    # traits are: search, highlight, sort, return, and facet. If an
    # analysis_scheme is specified, the scheme with that name will be applied
    # to the field. If the special locale_specific scheme is specified, a
    # field will be created for every locale (content_en, content_es_es, ...)
    # and the analysis_scheme specified in locales dict below will be applied
    # to the field.
    #
    # Some useful information regarding indexing options are available under
    # Configuring Index Options in AWS Cloud Search's documentation.
